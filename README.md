 Projects from the AI and Macine Learning for Coders


1. gettingStartedWithMachineLearning.py :
   - Uses a neural network with only one neuron and layer to model the equation of a linear line

2. fashionMNIST.py
   - uses a neural network with 3 layers of with neurons 784, 128, 10 respectively to classify images of different types of clothing
   - Utilises **keras inbuilt database** to get the training and test set

3. fashionMNISTCallback.py
   - same as 2 however utilises **callbacks** to stop training when the model accuracy reaches 95%
  
4. fashionMNISTCNN.py
   - same as fashionMNIST.py however uses convolutions
   - page 39: explains how to explore a model using 'model.summary'
